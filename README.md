The project utilizes several AWS services to integrate, prepare, and analyze data:

- **AWS Glue** - a serverless data integration service that simplifies the process of discovering, preparing, moving, and integrating data from multiple sources.
- **Crawler** - a component of AWS Glue that accesses the data store, extracts metadata, and creates table definitions in the AWS Glue Data Catalog.
- **Amazon Athena** - a service that enables data analysts to perform interactive queries on data stored in Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), a highly scalable and secure object storage service.
- **Amazon S3** - an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance.
